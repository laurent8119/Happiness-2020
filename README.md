# Happiness-2020  

2020 seems to be long ago but the Covid-19 pandemic is still not over in 2022. Do you wonder what was the happiest country back in 2020??  

I did an exploratory data analysis based on the raw data provided by the team who wrote the World Happiness report. This analysis is a personal project made in Python.  

Besides, I have created a PowerBi dashboard. As it canâ€™t be shared, you can check the screenshots in the pdf file.
